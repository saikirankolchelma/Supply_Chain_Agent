Supply Chain Agent  🚀

Welcome to the Supply Chain Agent ! This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, workflow, and implementation details of the agent. Let’s dive in! 💻✨

Overview 🌟

The Supply Chain Agent is a conversational AI tool designed to assist distributors by answering queries related to stock availability, order status, and pricing changes. It integrates a Streamlit frontend , a FastAPI backend , and an SQLite database to deliver seamless responses to user queries. The agent leverages the Mistral 7B v1 large language model (LLM) to generate human-readable responses.

Detailed Architecture

1. Frontend Layer 🖥️
   
     Built using Streamlit .
   
     Provides an interactive interface for users to enter queries.
   
     Sends user queries to the backend API via HTTP POST requests.
   
2. Backend Layer 🧠
 
    Built using FastAPI .
   
    Handles incoming queries from the frontend.
   
    Extracts intent and parameters (e.g., product name, order ID).
   
    Dynamically generates SQL queries based on the intent.

    Fetches data from the SQLite database.

    Formats the response using the Mistral 7B v1 LLM.
   
    Sends the formatted response back to the frontend.

   
4. Database Layer 🗄️
   
    Uses SQLite to store supply chain data (e.g., stock quantities, order statuses, prices).
   
    Executes SQL queries generated by the backend to retrieve required data.
   
6. Language Model Integration 🤖
   
    Leverages the Mistral 7B v1 LLM (via Hugging Face's huggingface_hub) to generate human-readable responses.
   
    Ensures that responses are clear, concise, and contextually accurate.
   
Application Workflow 🛠️

Here’s how the application works step by step:

1. User Interaction on Frontend 👤
   
    The user enters a query in the Streamlit interface and clicks the "Submit" button.

        Example query: "What is the stock of ProductX?".
   
3. Frontend Sends Query to Backend 📤
   
The frontend sends the query as a JSON payload to the FastAPI backend via an HTTP POST request:

    {
      "query": "What is the stock of ProductX?"
    }

5. Backend Processes the Query 🧠
   
The backend receives the query and performs the following steps:

a. Extract Intent and Parameters 🔍

Parses the query to extract relevant information (e.g., product name, order ID).

    Example: Extracts "ProductX" from "What is the stock of ProductX?".
    
b. Generate SQL Query 🔧

Dynamically generates an SQL query based on the intent (stock, order status, price).

Example: For stock queries:

    SELECT stock_quantity FROM supply_chain WHERE product_name = 'ProductX';
    
c. Fetch Data from Database 🗄️

Executes the SQL query against the SQLite database (supply_chain.db) to retrieve the required data.

    Example result: 50 units in stock for ProductX.
    
d. Format Response ✍️

Formats the fetched data into a human-readable response using the Mistral 7B v1 LLM.

    Example: "ProductX has 50 units in stock."
    
e. Return Response to Frontend 📥

Sends the formatted response back to the frontend as a JSON object:

    {
      "response": "ProductX has 50 units in stock."
    }
    
4. Frontend Displays Response 🎉
   
The frontend receives the response and displays it to the user in a user-friendly format.

    SELECT stock_quantity FROM supply_chain WHERE product_name = 'ProductX';
    Database Result : 50
    Response : "ProductX has 50 units in stock. ✅"
    Query: "What is the status of order 123?"

Backend SQL Query :

    SELECT order_status FROM supply_chain WHERE order_id = 123;
    Database Result : "Shipped"
    Response : "Order #123 status: Shipped. ✅"
    Query: "What is the price of ProductY?"
    
Backend SQL Query :

    SELECT current_price, old_price FROM supply_chain WHERE product_name = 'ProductY';
    Database Result : (5.99, 5.99)
    Response : "The price of ProductY is $5.99 (no recent changes). ✅"

Query: "What is the stock of NonExistentProduct?"

    Database Result : None
    Response : "No data available for NonExistentProduct. ⚠️"
